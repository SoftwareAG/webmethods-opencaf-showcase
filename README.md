# webmethods-opencaf-showcase
OpenCAF Component Showcase 9.10 and higher

## Description

This OpenCAF showcase demonstrates the majority of default JSF components available in webMethods Composite Application Framework (CAF). The code sample works with My webMethods Server 9.10 and higher.

The OpenCAF code sample illustrates the most important base functionality available in My webMethods Server for components, as well as more advanced topics such as drag-and-drop using HTML5 and incorporating third-party JavaScript libraries into a My webMethods Server portlet. The CAF components combine server-side and client-side rendering techniques to provide a rich, responsive user experience.

### Key Features of OpenCAF

* Supports extensive client-side functionality to improve richness, responsiveness, and scalability.
* Provides a flexible and consistent approach to My webMethods Server skins and shells across all components.
* Extends applications with third-party JavaScript frameworks to fit a customerâ€™s needs.
* Leverages existing CAF components and JSF 2.x standardized components including file upload and integrated AJAX support.

Components are grouped on the left-hand side bar according to their tag namespaces, with the majority of tags located under UI Tags. Each example displays a functional sample with the executing code displayed below. In some cases the backend Java code will also be displayed to make it easier to understand what is happening on the server side. Lines specific to each code sample have been highlighted to improve comprehension. Certain samples can only be viewed in a portlet context. For these samples you will be requested to log into My webMethods Server and then redirected back to the sample page.

### OpenCAF Application Installation Steps

1. Import the component showcase files into Software AG Designer.

2. Publish the showcase to My webMethods Server.

3. Navigate to http://*hostname*:8585/wm_opencaf_showcase to see the showcase.

### Tips

* For common components used by My webMethods server, see the caf_h tags.
* For standardized tags, go to the UI Tags > JSF Standard Tags menu. These tags also use the JSF 2.x AJAX refresh feature.
* In addition, there is a category that displays each of the renderers you can use for the generation of specific content such as posts, shells or properties.
